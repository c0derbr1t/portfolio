                        <!-- <h3>This last Build Week project, I was the Backend Developer and the Project Manager for the team. While the project was named Essentialism, the backend was complicated. I created the database and the endpoints based on conversations with my team about what we might want to build. This project is live, but not fully functional from a front end perspective. You can find the live site <a href="https://romantic-brown-0fe8a8.netlify.app/index.html" target="_blank"</a>here</a>. The landing page links to the rest of the front-end site, which uses my endpoints. You can use the username: <i>testing</i>, and the password: <i>123456</i>.</h3>

                        <h3>I intend to re-create this project (both front and back end) sometime to build on my skills.</h3> -->
                        <h3>What is this?</h3>
                        <p>Essentialism involves doing less, but better, so you can make the highest possible contribution. It's about getting the right things done and regaining control of our own choices and time-management. This application allows you to identify values important to you, and then choose the top 3 of those. You complete a prompt on why those 3 values are important. Then you can add projects/things you are currently involved in, and compare those items with your values.</p>

                        <h3>What kind of build was this?</h3>
                        <p>This was a remote, cross-functional team of 5 over 1 week. I worked as the sole Back-end Developer, as well as the Project Manager for my team.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>What did I do?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type:none"><strong>As Back-End Developer:</strong></li>
                            <li>I used DB Designer to design the database schema.</li>
                            <li>I set up the backend. I used xpress, helmet, and cors in the server. I made routers for authorization, users, values, prompts, and projects. I also created restricted middleware to only allow access to most of the routes while logged in.</li>
                            <li>In the authorization router, I used bcrypt and tokens to encrypt passwords during registration, and to check passwords during login.</li>
                            <li>I set up a .env file for secrets. Then made the dbConfig file using knex. I used knex migrations to create the tables for my database, and then I created seeds for each table.</li>
                            <li>I created models and routes for each section.</li>
                            <li>I created tests using jest and supertest </li>
                            <li>I used sqlite3 for development and testing, and postgres for production.</li>
                            <li>I created a very detailed Readme for the API including all routes, expected input and output, and error codes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type:none"><strong>As Project Manager:</strong></li>
                            <li>I created the repositories for the back-end, front-end, and marketing page.</li>
                            <li>I created the Trello Board.</li>
                            <li>I controlled the slack channel, and made sure my team had the information they needed accessible.</li>
                            <li>I helped our team be cohesive, and led discussions to help with team connectivity and morale.</li>
                            <li>I led daily stand-ups with my team to ensure the whole team was on the same page, and we were all aware of what had been done, and what still needed accomplished.</li>
                            <li>I celebrated accomplishments with team-members.</li>
                            <li>I provided constructive feedback on behavior and code.</li>
                            <li>I communicated with each team-member's Team Lead if neccessary.</li>
                            <li>I completed a retrospective at the end of the week, and review of each team member.</li>
                            <li>I assisted each person with their programming as neccessary, in a way that would help them understand and grow.</li>
                        </ul>
